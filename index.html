        <p>Alex Anderson looked at the cursed hawk in his hands and felt irritable.

            He walked over to the window and reflected on his hilly surroundings. He had always loved magical Philadelphia with its ratty, round rivers. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel irritable.
            
            Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Audra Costa. Audra was a delightful monster with vast elbows and tall fingers.
            
            Alex gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a gracious, peculiar, champgane drinker with ruddy elbows and charming fingers. His friends saw him as a gentle, gloopy god. Once, he had even helped a damaged old lady cross the road.
            
            But not even a gracious person who had once helped a damaged old lady cross the road, was prepared for what Audra had in store today.
            
            The wind blew like camping goldfish, making Alex confident.
            
            As Alex stepped outside and Audra came closer, he could see the unsightly smile on her face.
            
            "I am here because I want revenge," Audra bellowed, in an energetic tone. She slammed her fist against Alex's chest, with the force of 9877 elephants. "I frigging hate you, Alex Anderson."
            
            Alex looked back, even more confident and still fingering the cursed hawk. "Audra, I will kill you," he replied.
            
            They looked at each other with shocked feelings, like two dripping, depressed donkeys hiking at a very tactless party, which had flute music playing in the background and two brave uncles skipping to the beat.
            
            Alex regarded Audra's vast elbows and tall fingers. He held out his hand. "Let's not fight," he whispered, gently.
            
            "Hmph," pondered Audra.
            
            "Please?" begged Alex with puppy dog eyes.
            
            Audra looked angry, her body blushing like a talented, terrible torch.
            
            Then Audra came inside for a nice drink of champgane.</p>
